   > **A e-Health service software application**
<p>MedPort is a software application that serves as a hospital management system, designed to store and organize patient information within a secure database that allows users to easily manage the status and welfare of medical patients within any medical institution. <br>The software will have the facility to give a unique ID for search on every patient and staff and stores the details in a database.</p>

Write a program to perform Simple String Encryption. Your program should be able to perform the following tasks:
1. (20 points) read the user input which is the plain text. Do not use an existing library procedure
2. (30 points) uses a multi-character key to encrypt the plain text, producing the cipher text and display it on the screen.
3. (20 points) decrypt the cipher text, producing and displaying the original plain text on the screen.
The basic idea here is to use the “reversible” property of XOR . that is, If an integer X isXORed with Y and the resulting value is XORed with Y again, the value produced is X:
This provides an easy way to perform a simple form of data encryption: A plain text message is transformed into an encrypted string called cipher text byXORing each of its characters with a character from a third string called a key. The intended viewer can use the key to decrypt the cipher text and produce the original plain text.
The encryption process should proceed in the following manner:
i. Let the user enter an encryption key consisting of multiple characters.
ii. Use this key to encrypt and decrypt the plain-text by XORing each
character of the key against a corresponding byte in the message.
iii. Repeat the key as many times as necessary until all plain-text bytes
are translated.
